### ⚠️ Safety & Legal Notice  
This project is an **educational and experimental prototype** created for research and learning purposes.  
It is **not a certified commercial product or engineering device**.  
Users must operate any hardware components (microphones, servos, ultrasonic or optical devices) **within safe exposure limits** and comply with **local regulations**.  
The author assumes **no liability** for injury, misuse, or property damage resulting from the use or modification of this project.  
Always follow **laser, acoustic, and electrical safety guidelines** when building or demonstrating physical systems.

This software/hardware is provided as‐is, no warranty of any kind, the author is not liable for damages.

Operating this robot is at your own risk; you must comply with local laws for airborne devices, robotics safety, etc.

Regulatory / physical device compliance

If the robot flies, you may need to consider U.S. aviation / drone rules from Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or state/local regulations for unmanned aerial vehicles.

If the robot uses wireless transmissions, you may need to consider radio frequency / FCC rules.

If it uses sensors, audio/microphones, telepathy claims, or your code interacts with human data: consider privacy laws (e.g., audio recordings might implicate state consent laws).

You might want to check any state‐specific laws around robotics, unattended flying objects, surveillance/recording devices, or “living being” claims.

If your project captures audio, video, or other human-subject data (even if experimental), you should add a notice: user is responsible for ensuring recordings are legal, proper consent is obtained, etc.

If you distribute or allow others to use the system, you should include a privacy/disclaimer section in your README.

Usage warning: “This project is experimental. Use at your own risk. The author is not liable for injury or damage.”

Regulatory/Compliance reminder: “If you fly or use hardware in your jurisdiction you must comply with local drone/aircraft regulations and electronics/radio regulation.”

Privacy warning: “If you record audio/video/data you are responsible for complying with applicable privacy laws and obtaining consent.”

Scope disclaimer: “This is for educational/experimental use only. Not for commercial products, unless you obtain a separate license from the author.”

If you handle exports (e.g., code that uses encryption or advanced hardware sensors), check U.S. export control laws. Although for typical hobby robotics this is unlikely a major issue, it may still be worth a note.
