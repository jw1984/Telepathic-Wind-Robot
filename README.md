⚠️ Safety, Legal, and Regulatory Notice

This project is an educational and experimental prototype. It is not a certified commercial device, scientific instrument, consumer product, or engineering-grade robotics platform.

Use of this software, conceptual framework, or any associated hardware is entirely at your own risk.

Liability Disclaimer

This software/hardware is provided “as is,” without warranty of any kind, express or implied.
The author assumes no liability for injury, harm, property damage, device malfunction, or legal consequences resulting from the use, modification, or operation of this project.

🛠️ Hardware & Robotics Safety Requirements

If you construct or operate a physical robot using this code or concept:

Follow all electrical, mechanical, and acoustic safety guidelines.

Do not operate near people, pets, or property that may be harmed.

Ensure servos, motors, or flying components are secured and tested safely.

If the robot flies, complies with applicable FAA rules for unmanned aircraft.

📡 Regulatory & Compliance Responsibilities
1. Drone / Flying Robot Rules (U.S. FAA + Washington State)

If your device lifts off the ground or moves autonomously:

You must comply with FAA Part 107 or recreational drone rules.

Local city or county restrictions may apply in Washington State.

Indoor flight does not eliminate liability for injuries or damages.

2. Wireless Communication / FCC Rules

If your project uses wireless transmitters, radios, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or RF components:

Devices must conform to FCC Part 15 or other applicable radio regulations.

Modifying wireless transmission power may violate U.S. federal law.

3. Audio, Microphone, Telepathy, and Data Collection Laws

If your robot or software listens to, records, analyzes, or transmits audio:

Washington State is a two-party consent state for audio recording.

Users must obtain explicit consent before capturing human voices.

Do not use the microphone in public or private spaces without permission.

You are fully responsible for privacy, encryption, consent, and data security.

(“Telepathic energy visualization” is treated as a conceptual or artistic term and is not a legally recognized data type.)

4. Surveillance, Autonomous Behavior, and Ethics

Projects that detect, track, follow, or interact with humans may fall under:

state surveillance restrictions

harassment / stalking laws

trespass or nuisance statutes

autonomous device safety expectations

You are responsible for ensuring your usage does not violate any of the above.

5. Export Control (U.S. EAR/ITAR)

Although typical hobby robotics do not trigger export laws:

high-frequency sensing

autonomous navigation

encryption

advanced control systems

could require export-control review for distribution outside the U.S.

🔒 Privacy Notice

If you use this project with audio, video, sensor, or motion-tracking systems:

You must comply with all applicable privacy laws.

You must inform and obtain consent from all affected individuals.

You are solely responsible for how data is processed, stored, or transmitted.
