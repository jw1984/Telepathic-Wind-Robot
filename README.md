This software/hardware is provided as‐is, no warranty of any kind, the author is not liable for damages.

Operating this robot is at your own risk; you must comply with local laws for airborne devices, robotics safety, etc.

Regulatory / physical device compliance

If the robot flies, you may need to consider U.S. aviation / drone rules from Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or state/local regulations for unmanned aerial vehicles.

If the robot uses wireless transmissions, you may need to consider radio frequency / FCC rules.

If it uses sensors, audio/microphones, telepathy claims, or your code interacts with human data: consider privacy laws (e.g., audio recordings might implicate state consent laws).

You might want to check any state‐specific laws around robotics, unattended flying objects, surveillance/recording devices, or “living being” claims.
